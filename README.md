# inference-engine

In this assignment, we develop an inference engine for propositional logic, focusing on three primary inference methods: Truth Table (TT) checking, Forward Chaining (FC), and Backward Chaining (BC). Propositional logic is a branch of logic that deals with propositions, which are statements that can either be true or false. An inference engine is a core component of an intelligent system that applies logical rules to a knowledge base to deduce new information or answer queries
